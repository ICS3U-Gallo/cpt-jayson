### Dungeon survivor
This is an endless arcade game where your goal is to survive as long as possible. Use WASD to move your character and your mouse to aim and shoot (hold down a mouse button to shoot). The enemies will try to come in contact with you and once they do, you lose. You can get a powerup by killing 7 enemies. As time goes on in the game, the game gets harder (enemy hp and spawn rate goes up). 

Survive as long as possible and aim to get a new highscore

### Groups

Being in a group means having a cohesive game theme and story. It **does not** mean using other team member's code and repurposing it as your own. Each person's contributions must be utterly unique.

There are things that are allowed to be copied. These are exampled of things that will not be marked as part of your contribution:
- Images and game assets
- The drawing of specific game characters or scenery

If you do copy someone else's code in this regard, you *must* give them an attribution with a comment as follows.

```python
# Written by Dave D.
# dave_cpt.py
for x in range(100, 500, 50):
    pygame.draw.rect(....)
# ------------------
```

## Requirements

## Submission
If you are in a group, only one person will sumbit on behalf of the entire group.

### Play-through Video
Each group is to submit one play-through video (Five minutes) and explain it.

### Code explanation video
Each group member is to submit a five minute explanation of their own code and how it works. You must find examples of each of the topics in the requirements. If you have too many to show, just show your best work. The video's filename *must* include your full name.

### GitHub code
Be sure to constantly update your GitHub repository.
